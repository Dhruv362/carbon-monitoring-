            <div class="description">Average Carbon Footprint: 10-20 metric tons of CO₂ per year (depending on location and lifestyle).<BR>
                Explanation:
                Men typically tend to have higher carbon footprints than women, primarily due to higher spending on transportation (cars, flights) and sometimes a higher energy-intensive diet (e.g., meat consumption).
                Studies show that men often spend more on fuel-intensive activities like driving or commuting, which accounts for a significant share of their emissions.
                Men also tend to have larger personal space (bigger houses, more electricity usage), which can increase household carbon emissions

            <div class="description">Average Carbon Footprint: 8-15 metric tons of CO₂ per year.
                <br>Explanation:
                Women generally have a lower carbon footprint compared to men, with a higher proportion of their emissions coming from food, health, and services (less focus on transport and fuel-heavy products).
                Women are also more likely to make sustainable lifestyle choices, such as reducing meat consumption or choosing eco-friendly products.
                However, some studies also indicate that women may have higher carbon footprints in categories like clothing and healthcare, though these tend to be less carbon-intensive than transport or energy consumption.</div>

            <img src="BOY1.png" alt="Photo 3">
            <div class="description">Average Carbon Footprint: 3-5 metric tons of CO₂ per year.
                <br>Explanation:
                Boys' carbon footprint is lower because they depend on their parents for food, shelter, and transportation. They don’t usually drive or control household energy use.
                However, boys may influence their household’s footprint through diet, electronic usage (gaming, watching TV), and participation in energy-intensive hobbies.
                Children generally contribute indirectly to the family carbon footprint through food consumption, waste generation, and clothing</div>

            <img src="GIRL.png" alt="Photo 4">
            <div class="description">Average Carbon Footprint: 2.5-4.5 metric tons of CO₂ per year.
                <br>Explanation:
                Similar to boys, girls rely on their household’s consumption patterns, but on average, their energy and transport-related consumption tend to be slightly lower.
                This is because boys typically spend more time on gaming devices and electronic gadgets, which consume more electricity, while girls might have slightly different spending patterns related to school and hobbies.
                Girls might also influence the family's footprint through their dietary preferences and fashion, though their direct impact on carbon emissions remains low.</div>

            <img src="BABY.png" alt="Photo 5">
            <div class="description">Average Carbon Footprint: 1-2 metric tons of CO₂ per year.
                <br>Explanation:
                Babies have a very low direct carbon footprint since they don't consume energy or transport in the way adults do.
                Their carbon footprint comes primarily from the production and consumption of baby products such as diapers, baby food, clothing, and toys.
                The household footprint can also increase due to extra heating, laundry, and transportation to doctor visits or daycare.
                Disposable products, especially diapers, and baby formula contribute to the carbon footprint due to their manufacturing and disposal</div>
